    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Beyond being recognized as the gastronomic epicenter and culinary capital of the Philippines, Pampanga is a multifaceted city. Although the province is mostly known for their servings of delicious Kapampangan food, it has a certain depth to it that goes beyond gustatory sensations.

        Most vacation trips to the province would commence with a routinary food trip or almost always culminate in a sampling of their famous dishes from homegrown restaurants. Some of its favorite and known restaurants see a regular influx of both locals and tourists insomuch that they have been considered as somewhat of a Pampanga tourist spot themselves. Unfortunately, while lauded for its great food and excellent epicurean delights, most people—especially travelers from abroad—would rarely associate it with anything else other than a place that caters mainly to our gustatory impulses. However, while Pampanga is that one and definitive province for indulging our food cravings and taking our taste buds on an adventure, Filipino and foreign travelers should not overlook the other aspects of the area that would make it an enticing haven to spend the holidays.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>It has been widely believed and theorized by many that Kapampangans are linguistically distinct from the Tagalogs who surround them. Many said that they are descendants from migrants from the Malang Region in Central Java in the past. However, thriving settlements and communities already existed along the marshy banks of the coast and rivers even before Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1571 making their descent a moot point to some. The province’s name was from the fact that many of its inhabitants lived in river banks. La Pampanga, initially the name assigned to the area by the Spanish conquerors, translated to a river bank. The province’s creation dating back to 1571 makes it the first Spanish province in the Philippines. Before the Spanish conquistadors arrived, Pampanga had a caste system consisting of the datu or chiefs, the timawa or freeborn and the salves. Several datu existed in a community, but only the powerful were allowed to rule exercising executive, judicial and military control. The position was attained mainly through birth and is hereditary, but a datu can be easily replaced when their control over their titles weakened.</p>
